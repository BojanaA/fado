				<p align="justify">Having taken on flamenco ("Sevillanas") and tango ("Tango"), Carlos Saura tackles a third great melancholy music style,
					directing "Fados," a celebration of Portugal's classic, lamenting acoustic folk songs. The film combines fado performances
					from top artists, dance from Portugal, Brazil and Cape Verde and archive footage. In the song centrepieces, artists
					deliver contemporary versions of fado classics. Lined up fadistas include young female star Mariza as well as Grammy
					award-winner Carlos do Carmo. Renowned diva Amália Rodrigues is remembered through arquive footage while the exploration
					of fado's influences and roots gives opportunities to embrace prestigious Brazilian performers Caetano Veloso, Chico
					Buarque and the emerging Cape Verdean star Lura. Fados is a 2007 Spanish film directed by Carlos Saura. The film, a
					fusion of cinema, song, dance and instrumental numbers, explores Portugal's most emblematic musical genre, fado, and
					its spirit of saudade (melancholy). Using Lisbon as its iconic backdrop, the film explores the intricate relationship
					between the music and the city, and Fado's evolution over the years from its African and Brazilian origins up to the
					new wave of modern Fadistas. Under the musical supervision of Carlos do Carmo, Fados completed Saura's musical trilogy
					form with Flamenco (1995) and Tango (1998). Saura deploys mirrors, back projections, lighting effects, and lush colors
					to frame each song. Fados contains homages to Maria Severa, Alfredo Marceneiro, and Amália Rodrigues, as well as turns
					by modern stars like Mariza and Camané. Saura expands the songs (which traditionally involve just a singer and a guitarist)
					with dance and encompasses other nationalities of Portugal’s former colonies and idioms (such as hip hop, flamenco and
					reggae).</p>
