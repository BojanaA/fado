						<font color="black">
							<p align="justify"> Across the world, fado is a musical symbol of Portuguese culture and tradition. This melancholic genre, which translates
								to “fate” in Latin, reveals the passion in the Portuguese disposition, and evokes a despairing belief in a futile
								destiny filled with pining and hopelessness.</p>
							<p align="justify">Each region in Portugal has a musical style and fado, in particular, started in Lisbon although it soon diverged into
								differing forms in Porto and Coimbra. Due to its emergence in the early 19th century during a time of diverse cultural
								encounters, there are many projections about the birth of fado. Some say it came with African slaves and was adapted
								from a West African dance in Brazil while others believe that it was developed from a song of lament by Portuguese
								seafarers or was developed during the Moorish occupation of Portugal.</p>
							<p align="justify">The singer of fado (literally, “fate”) speaks to the often harsh realities of everyday life, sometimes with a sense
								of resignation, sometimes with the hope of resolution. The music is performed by either a female or a male vocalist,
								typically to the accompaniment of one or two guitarras (10- or 12-string guitars), one or two violas (6-string guitars),
								and perhaps also a viola baixo (a small 8-string bass viola). Most of the repertoire follows a duple metre (usually
								with four beats to a measure), with a text arranged in quatrains or in any of several other common Portuguese poetic
								forms. Until the mid-20th century many fado performances featured a significant element of improvisation. Inevitably
								enriched with an array of emotive bodily gestures and facial expressions, fado aims—and indeed, is required—to evoke
								a penetrating sense of saudade (roughly, “yearning”).</p>

						<p align="justify">The popularization of fado in the 1830s is widely attributed to Maria Severa, a tavern singer in the Alfama and the
							first famous fadista. To the accompaniment of guitars, Severa sang of real-life woes in the harmonically predictable,
							notably improvisational, and strikingly mournful manner that came to characterize the Lisbon style. The dark shawl
							that she wore during her performances, became a standard accessory for subsequent generations of female fadistas.</p>

							of an estimated 170 albums. In 1947 she starred in her first film, Capas Negras .Renowned for her passionate performances,
							Rodrigues pushed the Lisbon style in new directions, incorporating Spanish and Mexican rhythms and tapping contemporary
							poets for her lyrics. </p>

							to a global audience. Her third album, Transparente (2005), angered some purists by breaking with the traditional
							fado sound and including sweeping orchestral string arrangements and up-tempo, Django Reinhardt-inspired guitar accompaniment.

								<h3>Fado de Lisboa</h3>

							</header>
							<hr />
							<font color="black">
								<p align="justify"> There are two distinct styles of fado, the older of which is associated with the city of Lisbon and the younger with
									the north-central Portuguese city of Coimbra. The Lisbon style emerged in the first half of the 19th century, following
									the 1822 return to Portugal of the Portuguese government, which had been removed to Brazil during the Napoleonic
									Wars. It arose in the city’s Alfama district, a socially and economically marginalized area that was a nexus of
									Iberian, South American (particularly Brazilian), and African peoples and traditions. A diverse array of dance traditions
									circulated within this milieu, including the Afro-Brazilian lundum; the Brazilian fado (distinct from the song genre
									that bears the same name); the fofa, which was common both in Portugal and in Brazil; and the Spanish fandango.
									Also popular at the time was the modinha, a type of Portuguese and Brazilian art song that often was accompanied
									by the guitar. The musics of these dance traditions merged with the modinha, ultimately giving birth to fado.</p>

								<h3>Coimbra fado</h3>

							</header>
							<hr />
							<font color="black">
								<p align="justify"> The second style of fado developed roughly from the 1870s to the 1890s in the university city of Coimbra. In contrast
									to the Lisbon style, which sprang from a sidelined segment of society, appealed to working-class audiences, and
									included many female performers, the Coimbra style (also called canção de Coimbra, “songs of Coimbra”) was generally
									a product and a pastime of the privileged classes, and it was typically performed by men. Cultivated in cafés by
									college students and university faculty, the new fado drew from the city’s deep literary tradition, as well as from
									bel canto singing and diverse musical styles brought by students from various regions of Portugal. A further difference
									between the Coimbra and Lisbon styles was the manner in which they addressed the hardships of everyday life: the
									fado of Coimbra inspired hope, while that of Lisbon suggested surrender. Other distinctive features of the Coimbra
									style included a lack of improvisation (performances were solidly rehearsed) and the elevation of the guitarras
									and violas to a position of prominence from what had been an essentially accompanimental role. Indeed, the Coimbra
									tradition generated a separate, instrumental repertoire for guitar.</p>
